# Cashu JDK

> **Low-level Java implementation of the [Cashu](https://cashu.space) protocol.**  
> Not recommended for general use.

This is a minimal, low-level and stateless reimplementation of the Cashu protocol in Java, built with full control and customization in mind.  
If you're not already familiar with how Cashu works internally, **you probably shouldn't use this.**

For 99% of use cases, you're better off using the [CDK](https://github.com/cashubtc/cdk) FFI bindings.
